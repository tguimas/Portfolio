# Copilot Chatbot Flows - Gym Info & Product Orders

### Overview
Three flows were created to support the Copilot chatbot end-to-end:

Information flow: When users ask questions about the gym (e.g., services, schedules, rules) or about products available for sale, the chatbot triggers a flow that retrieves the relevant information and responds immediately.

Purchase request flow: If a user indicates they want to buy a product, another flow captures the purchase intent, collects the necessary details, and registers the request in the database to ensure it’s tracked and can be processed by the team.

Confirmation flow: After the request is successfully recorded, a final flow automatically sends a confirmation email to the user, acknowledging that the request was registered and providing a clear reference for next steps.
